# Marketing Data Analysis using ML
*UPDATE (11/17): Accuracy measures are based on sklearn package's model function scores, in this case classification rate*
### Summary
* Prepared data (removing null values, feature selection) for model building
* Evaluated Regression (Linear, Logistic) and Support Vector Machines on the dataset to determine the best model to predict a customer's response
* Predicting a potential customer's response based on its customer profile using the best model (Support Vector Classifier)

Project Background:
* This is an updated version of my final project for a Machine Learning class I took at Brandeis International Business School.
* It encompasses Data preprocessing, ML Model evaluation, as well as Predictive analytics
* **Question: How can we use consumer spending data to predict a customer's response to a digital marketing campaign?**


Data Background:
* The data is for a digital marketing campaign for food products and mainly includes consumer spending data, as well as results from digital marketing campaign
* Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data).

Packages used:
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
